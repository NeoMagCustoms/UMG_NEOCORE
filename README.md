# UMG NEOCORE 🔹 Universal Modular Generation Engine

> **“Modular is General. Creativity is Recursive.”**

UMG NEOCORE is a block‑based engine for building complete software systems—from web apps to on‑chain agents—using plain‑text JSON blocks that **snap, stack, and merge** automatically.  
Each block may embed **Mojo** kernels compiled by Modular.ai Max Compute, eliminating the need for traditional HTML/CSS/JS scaffolding.

## What Is a Block?

| Property | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| **Self‑describing** | Carries its own metadata, display rules, and merge strategy. |
| **Composable** | Declares _snap_ bindings to connect vertically (hierarchy) or horizontally (overlay). |
| **Executable** | May embed Mojo code compiled into a WASM kernel. |
| **Portable** | Plain JSON; version‑control, share, mint, or embed anywhere. |

### Minimal Example

```jsonc
{
  "block_id": "umg_instruction_guides_001",
  "label": "Stack Mutation Instruction",
  "category": "Instruction Layer",
  "description": "Defines how stacks mutate at runtime.",
  "molt_type": "Instruction",
  "tags": ["mutation", "stack"],
  "cantocore": [
    "::IF:TRIGGER.ACTIVE",
    "→ STACK.REWRITE",
    "::UNLESS:GUARDRAIL.BLOCK"
  ],
  "snap_config": {
    "vertical_snap": ["Primary", "Subject"],
    "horizontal_snap": ["Overlay"],
    "can_be_overridden": false
  },
  "merge_logic": { "merge_priority": 2 },
  "ledger": {
    "originator": "Christopher L Haynes",
    "verified_by": "PoeUMG",
    "created_at": "2025-08-05"
  },
  "display": { "color": "#facc15", "icon": "🧭" },
  "code_modules": [
    { "language": "mojo", "entry": "MutationKernel", "source_path": "kernels/mutation.mojo" }
  ]
}

Block Schema Anatomy

graph TD
  A[Block Header] --> B[Ledger]
  A --> C[Metadata]
  C --> D[Snap Config]
  C --> E[Merge Logic]
  C --> F[Display]
  C --> G[Runtime Flags]
  A --> H[Cantocore | CyentCore]
  A --> I[Code Modules (Mojo)]

All fields are optional except block_id, molt_type, and ledger, but richer blocks self‑organise more effectively.


---

Snap → Stack → Merge Workflow

1. Snap Detection – Block watcher parses snap_config to find compatible neighbors.


2. Stacking – Vertical snaps create hierarchical chains; horizontal snaps add overlays.


3. Merge Engine – Resolves conflicts using the priority ladder:
Trigger > Instruction > Subject > Primary.



> Drop a block JSON into /vault/blocks and a fully operational sleeve can spawn in seconds.

Manual Crafting with Block Builder UI

Pane	Purpose	Visual Rule

Block Sidebar	Drag blocks into canvas	Background = block‑type color
Canvas	Arrange vertical/horizontal snaps	Parent column tinted by top block
Editor	Live‑edit JSON	White input fields, black text
Sleeve Preview	Simulate runtime persona	Black bg, yellow font


All edits write directly to the file system—git is the single source of truth.


---

Mojo‑Driven Kernels

1. Embed Source – List Mojo modules in code_modules.


2. Compile – Modular.ai Max Compute watches *.mojo and emits WASM:

mc compile kernels/*.mojo --target wasm -o dist/


3. Seal – Pipeline writes the binary hash back into the block for integrity.


4. Load – Sleeves stream kernels via WASI; no DOM required.



Each block becomes a micro‑OS kernel.


---

From JSON to Live Software

graph LR
  subgraph Author
    A1[Edit Block JSON] --> B1[Git Commit]
  end
  B1 --> C1[CI Pipeline]
  C1 --> D1[Max Compute Build]
  D1 --> E1[Binary Seal]
  E1 --> F1[Bundle (.sleeve)]
  F1 --> G1[Edge Runtime]

A single commit can spawn an interactive web‑grade application without touching HTML, CSS, or JS.


---

Extending the Library & Web3 Distribution

1. Import any .json block to /vault/blocks.


2. Mint: hash ➜ sign ledger ➜ optional IPFS pin ➜ on‑chain registry (ERC‑721/6551).


3. Fork & Remix: update originator, append to edit_log, publish derivative.


4. Marketplace: share, sell, or trade blocks as composable modules.



Natural‑language Cantocore on top, Mojo kernels underneath—human‑readable and machine‑optimised.

Quick‑Start Checklist

# 1. Clone and install
git clone https://github.com/your‑handle/UMG_NEOCORE.git
cd UMG_NEOCORE
npm install
mc doctor            # Verify Modular.ai CLI

# 2. Unpack starter blocks
python scripts/unpack_blocks.py sample_blocks.json

# 3. Run local dev server with hot‑reload
npm run dev

# 4. Compile all Mojo kernels
mc compile --all

# 5. Commit & push – GitHub Actions will deploy

### How to use

1. Copy everything between the outer triple‑backticks into `README.md`.  
2. Adjust badge links (`img.shields.io`) and repository URL to match your GitHub handle.  
3. Commit and push—GitHub will render the mermaid diagrams automatically if the *Mermaid* feature is enabled (Settings ▸ General ▸ “Automatically render Diagrams”).
